# 120-work

<h1>Tennessee Glenn</h1>

<h3>This is Tennessee Glenn's repo for course work related to Creative Coding 1.</h3>

To complete this assignment I followed the steps prescribed on the creative coding Moodle.

<ol type="1">
<li>Created Github account</li>
<li>Installed desktop version of Github</li>
<li>Published my desktop version of Github to the online version</li>
<li>Installed a text editor (I decided to go with Atom)</li>
<li>dded theme to text editor</li>
<li>Added a commit to desktop Github and synced this to online Github </li>
</ol>

<b><u>Issues I had this week</u></b>

<ul>

<li> I kept getting lost at first between Atom and Github. I wasn't sure where I should be working at times but I eventually got it figured out.
</li>
<br>
<li> My second and much bigger issue was that I didn't know how see my code as I typed. My partner told me I should have something like she'd experienced in Dreamweaver where I could see a preview of what my code would look like as I wrote it. I checked the forum issues and looked around at other student's work and realized there was a way to preview my code as I typed. I went into Packages and used Markdown Preview </li>

This is a website I used for some reference when I got a little confused: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">www.w3schools.com</a>


Unfortunately I haven't interacted with my classmates on GitHub. I need to manage my time better and will be a lot more interactive this week.
