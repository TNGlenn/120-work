# Week Three
**1. Summary:**

This week we used a javascript file to create a simple sketch.
We experimented with determining a size and changing the background color of the sketch canvas.

**2. Completing the Assignment**

First I had to download the p5s. Then I opened a new file. I struggled a lot basically every step of the way unfortunately. I watched the tutorials a lot and even checked out some other tutorials on youtube and was able to scrape along.

**3. Problems/Issues**

I think my biggest issue was in trying to view my sketch as I typed the code (again). I also struggled to get the site live as well as linking my image. 


**5. Classmate help**

I’m definitely not fit to help anyone but I have been looking at other’s submissions to try to figure out my own issues.

**6. My Workspace**
